## Very good examples of Tasks for a better understanding of Ansible

> Ansible allows you to describe the configuration to be applied to our different servers through recipes written in YAML. 
> These recipes contain a series of tasks that will be launched one after the other. 
> The tasks use Ansible's internal modules that describe the operations to be performed and the launch conditions.
